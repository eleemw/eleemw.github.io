Technology has always piqued my interest. Yet, I would not really call myself a 'tech person.' In fact, I would even go so far as to say I am low tech in comparison to my millennial peers. While growing up, we did not have a computer at home. Nor did we have video games of any sort and the one tv that we owned only got 6 channels. So how is it that I wound up here in a web developer program? 

There have been several dabbles into the tech world here and there throughout my life: a class or two here, summer school programs, etc. None of it amounting to much of anything. Primarily because of my of bias of what a 'tech person' should look like and not feeling that I myself was one. This began to change last year when my employer entrusted me with additional responsibilities that included creating a client's website amongst other things. I attended a bootcamp on website development just to get the basic skills that I would need to do the job. It was there that my eyes were opened to just what programming is: problem solving. Here were people of all different types of demographics working together, implementing critical thinking and creativity to solve a proplem. I was hooked right then and there. Puzzles, of all types, have always been a hobby of mine. Riddles, jiggsaw puzzles, word problems, I love them all! Give me a puzzle or a problem and not only will I enthusiastically accept the challenge but likely will not focus on anything else until it is solved. From there I went on to take another bootcamp, and then another, and then another. The more that I learned the more I wanted to know. I had stumbled into the puzzle goldmine. Programming is the endless puzzle that I have been searching for. I am continuously looping between curious intrigue and dumbfounded frustration and absolutely loving it! Code has added a new passion to my life. One that I can continue to cultivate and explore without every worrying that I will run out of new pieces to discover or problems to solve.
